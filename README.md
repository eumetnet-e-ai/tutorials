# tutorials

EUMETNET E-AI is a programme "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Weather, Climate and Environmental Applications". 

We are a community of weather services in Europe, with many partners from academia, research institutes and industry. 

Collecting targeted tutorials for helping our scientists to learn about AI techniques and methods are being developed by many of our institutions. EUMETNET will work with tutorials and contribute to some of them, and make them accessible for our community.
